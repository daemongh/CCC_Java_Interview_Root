# ais_billaround-root

This is the root for components used during the AIS Billaround processing.

This is NOT the project that ingests, transforms, or loads the data for AIS Billaround.

It is just the components that those projects use and the overall documentation.

Note that this project does not directly specify the "current" version of this work.
